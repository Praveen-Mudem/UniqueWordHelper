# UniqueWordHelper

Given multiple text files, will count the occurrences of each unique word in the files and aggregate the results. Processing of the data should be done in a way to minimize running time, independent of the number of files or file size.

 For example, consider two files:

  - File 1 containing the text “Go do that thing that you do so well”

  - File 2 containing the text “I play football well”

-- It should find these counts: 

1: Go

2: do

2: that

1: thing

1: you

1: so

2: well

1: I

1: play

1: football
